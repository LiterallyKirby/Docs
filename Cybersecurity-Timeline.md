# **🎮 \+ 🛡️ Game Hacking ↔ Cybersecurity Roadmap (Rust/Go Edition)**

- [x] ### ~~**Week 1 – Memory Basics (Rust 🦀)**~~

* 🎮 Find health/ammo with Cheat Engine

* 🛡️ Study heap vs stack (gdb/volatility)

* 🖥️ Program: Simple process memory reader (Rust FFI → libc)

* 🔧 Tools: Cheat Engine, `gdb`, `x64dbg`

---

- [x] ### ~~**Week 2 – Memory Scanning (Rust 🦀)**~~

* 🎮 Write a memory scanner (search integers)

* 🛡️ Study malware that manipulates memory

* 🖥️ Program: Scanner CLI in Rust (ptrace/ReadProcessMemory)

* 🔧 Tools: Rust \+ `libc` crate

---

- [ ] ### **Week 3 – Code Injection (Rust 🦀 or C)**

* 🎮 DLL injection (Win) / `LD_PRELOAD` (Linux)

* 🛡️ Learn API hooking & detection

* 🖥️ Program: Injector in Rust (`unsafe` FFI)

* 🔧 Tools: Rust, OS APIs

---

- [ ] ### **Week 4 – Function Hooking (Rust 🦀 Or C)**

* 🎮 Hook a function (damage/jump logic)

* 🛡️ Compare to syscall hooking (rootkits)

* 🖥️ Program: Inline hook in Rust (assembly \+ unsafe)

* 🔧 Tools: Rust, maybe `dynasm-rs` for assembly

---

- [ ] ### **Week 5 – Reverse Engineering (Go Rust, or C)**

* 🎮 Find game logic in Ghidra

* 🛡️ Reverse engineer a crackme

* 🖥️ Program: Rust (disassembly parser) or Go (helper tools)

* 🔧 Tools: Ghidra, Radare2

---

- [ ] ### **Week 6 – Binary Patching (Rust 🦀)**

* 🎮 Patch binary to bypass a check

* 🛡️ Learn about DEP, ASLR

* 🖥️ Program: Binary patcher in Rust (open, seek, write bytes)

* 🔧 Tools: Hex editor, Rust std::fs

---

- [ ] ### **Week 7 – Network Sniffing (Go 🐹)**

* 🎮 Capture packets with Wireshark

* 🛡️ Study replay/fuzzing

* 🖥️ Program: Packet parser in Go (pcap library)

* 🔧 Tools: Go \+ gopacket, Wireshark

---

- [ ] ### **Week 8 – Packet Replays (Go 🐹)**

* 🎮 Replay/fuzz packets

* 🛡️ Practice IDS/IPS analysis

* 🖥️ Program: Python-style replay but in Go (Scapy alternative: gopacket)

* 🔧 Tools: Go, Wireshark

---

- [ ] ### **Week 9 – Anti-Cheat vs EDR (Rust 🦀)**

* 🎮 Study anti-cheat (hashing/hooks)

* 🛡️ Compare to antivirus detection

* 🖥️ Program: Rust integrity checker (hash exe \+ detect hooks)

* 🔧 Tools: Rust crypto crates

---

- [ ] ### **Week 10 – Automation (Go 🐹)**

* 🎮 Bot that farms resources (pixel detection)

* 🛡️ Automate pentesting scans

* 🖥️ Program: Go \+ robotgo (keyboard/mouse control) or OpenCV bindings

* 🔧 Tools: Go, robotgo, OpenCV

---

- [ ] ### **Week 11 – Exploits (Rust 🦀)**

* 🎮 Create a buffer overflow in a mod/game you control

* 🛡️ Study stack smashing & ROP

* 🖥️ Program: Rust exploit PoC (unsafe \+ FFI)

* 🔧 Tools: Rust, GDB \+ pwndbg

---

- [ ] ### **Week 12 – Capstone Project (Go or Rust)**

* 🎮 Build a full trainer (memory \+ injection \+ automation)

* 🛡️ Do a CTF (reversing, memory, networking)

* 🖥️ Program: Rust core (low-level hacks) \+ Go helpers (automation/UI)

* 🔧 Tools: All above
